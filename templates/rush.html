        <h2>Rush</h2>
        <p>Rush is your chance to learn more about Theta Tau.
            Throughout several events, you’ll get a feel for what our fraternity represents,
            whether you’re a good fit for us, and whether we’re a good fit for you.
            At the end of rush, a select number of students will be invited to interviews
            and may receive bids. Those offered bids can then choose whether they’d like to
            continue the PNM process.</p>
